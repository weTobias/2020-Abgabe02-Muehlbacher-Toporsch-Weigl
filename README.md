# Software Configuration Management Exercise 02 #

This exercise should teach us how to work with git, maven and generics. For this, we have to complete different 
tasks on a given project. Additionally, the resulting project should implement a new version of the original project, but with the use of generics.
It will also have corresponding test classen to get 100% test coverage.

## Original Project ##
The original project is a implementation of the Queue datastructure, without using the Queue collection, provided by Java.
The implementation handles Queue operations for String elements.

## Generics Queue ##

## Tasks ##
Tasks that should be completed. Documentation for every part of code is mandatory for every task.

**Original Project**
- [ ] Find mistakes and correct them.

**Generics implementation**
- [ ] Create a new implemetation of the queue, that handles different types of data with the use of generics.

**Testing**
- [ ] Create test classes for every class and get 100% test coverage.
