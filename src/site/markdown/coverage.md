# Code Coverage #
Code coverage is a measure to describe the degree to which the source code is executed when a test suite runs.
A program with high test coverage has had more of its source code executed during testing, that suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs.

## Why is it useful ##
Code Coverage helps developers to write better tests and helps to keep their code not to fall outside of the development scope.
As more code is executed in tests, more mistakes and similar errors are surfaced.
Furthermore code coverage also reveals un-executed application code and highlights omissions and allows the developer to improve the robustness of code.
Apart from that coverage also educates developers and provides valuable insight into how the programm works.
